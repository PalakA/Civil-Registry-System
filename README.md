# Civil-Registry-System

- It is a system by which a government records the vital events of its citizens. The resulting repository or database is called civil register or registry, or population registry.
- The main purpose of the web site is to reduce the effort by the candidate and save his time avoiding unwanted rushes at the government offices.
- These establish the occurrence of birth, death, or marriage and therefore provide prima facie evidence of facts surrounding these events. 
- The primary objective of this web site is to give awareness about the government or legal documents and its registration details as well as to help to register or apply for those documents. 
- The secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics.
